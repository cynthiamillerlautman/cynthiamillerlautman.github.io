It can be a challenge to explain Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) to young children – ones who have it, as well as their friends, siblings and other relatives.

Social stories are a great way to illustrate what some of the effects of SPD are.  They can also help explain how some of the treatment protocols, like a sensory diet, can help kids deal with SPD.  Even adults have a hard time understanding what Sensory Processing Disorder is, and these simple stories can let anyone understand, especially family members who really don’t get it.

A good technique to help adult family members understand SPD a is to have the adult (uncle, aunt, grandparent, etc.) read these books to your child.
