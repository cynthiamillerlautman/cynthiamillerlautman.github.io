### I am no longer accepting new clients for OT treatments###
I specialize in pediatric Occuaptional Therapy.  Some of the areas where I can help your child reach their potential are:

## Fine Motor Development ##

+ Development of the muscles of the hands to do everyday tasks such as opening containers, manipulating small objects, writing, dressing.
+ Cutting with scissors
+ Writing: Using methods such as Handwriting Without Tears and ABC BOUM to help children develop clear and automatic letter formation, proper spacing, prevent letter reversals and stay in the lines.

## Sensory Motor Development ##

+ Helping students that have trouble coping with everyday sensations i.e. clothes labels, lights or noises.
+ Students who need more than average movement i.e. spinning constantly, out of their seat, trouble staying focused.
+ Trouble with ball skills, jumping, going up and down stairs, balance, coordination, arm strength, shoulder dissociation etc.
+ Oral Motor issues:  sensitive to brushing teeth, very sensitive to food textures and temperatures,  constantly putting objects in mouth past 3 years of age.

## Cognitive Perceptual Development ##

+ Trouble with: puzzles, memory, reversals of letters or numbers, copying from the board, copying block structures etc.

## Activities of Daily Living ##

+ Dressing (zippers, buttons, shoe tying etc.)
+ Hygiene (hand washing, shaving, teeth brushing etc.)
+ Eating: Using a knife and fork, opening containers, preparing juice box, taking too big bites
+ Other tasks of everyday living: using a telephone, cooking, calling 911, simple money skills


A typical therapeutic relationship begins with an occupational therapy evaluation, which is carried out over several sessions.  Following the evaluation, a formal report is prepared that will identify different areas that can be targeted for improvement.  Working closely with my clientâ€™s parents, we can establish goals which will be targeted during therapy.
In addition to working during therapy, home programs and school programs can be provided.
