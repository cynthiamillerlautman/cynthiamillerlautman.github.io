      <h2>Connecting with Autism & Other Disabilities</h2>
  <p>This workshop is a two-part, 7-hour conference, aimed at presenting best practice, hands-on tools to help manage behavioural challenges experienced by individuals with autism, ADHD, FASD, mental health challenges, or even for individuals displaying problem behaviours unrelated to any diagnosis.
