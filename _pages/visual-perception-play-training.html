      Visual perception is an area that occupational therapists have always focused on with respect to assessment and treatment.  However, we are increasingly finding that the skills learned in the isolation of therapy are not generalized to the home and classroom.
</p>
<p>
All the different areas of visual perception will be covered, as well as how difficulties in these areas can impact both daily living and academics.  Even something as basic as finding their locker in the morning or getting out a pencil requires many areas of visual perception for children.
<p>
During the second half of the session,  you’ll be getting a chance to try a variety of board games and activities.  You’ll have the opportunity to test your new knowledge and guess what areas of visual perception they are working on.
