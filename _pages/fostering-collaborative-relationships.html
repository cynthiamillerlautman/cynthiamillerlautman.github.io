    <h2 >Connecting Schools, Professionals and Parents</h2>
  <p>In the era of earlier and better detection of child disabilities there is a whole new world that parents, educators, administrators and professionals must enter.  More than ever the way we communicate, show empathy and collaborate can make or break how a child and family succeed in an underfunded system.
</p>
<p>
In this conference, Cynthia Miller-Lautman Occupational Therapist will teach techniques to develop the most collaborative relationships so best client care can be obtained.  The focus will be on empathy, empathetic listening, collaboration and client centeredness.
